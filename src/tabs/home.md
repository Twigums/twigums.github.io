# home of all things <mark>Twiggles</mark>  
Hi! My name is <mark>twi</mark> (she/her). I am a **Data Scientist/ML Engineer** by day and an artist by night. Currently, I collect relevant data to develop computer vision solutions utilizing either traditional algorithms or machine learning. Outside of work, I enjoy all things technology while also staying true to the beauty of nature. I'm a big fan of rhythm games, archery, and ice-skating.

I believe in accessibility for all. Technology should be imperfect and human: designed by people with passions and expressions to share the culmination of their work to the world. If you do encounter any aspect of my site that is not consistent with my ethos, please feel free to make a pull request or contact me directly with your concerns!

Remember, life is beautiful, but not as beautiful as <mark>yours</mark>!

Feel free to [reach out to me](/contact/) to receive a detailed CV.
